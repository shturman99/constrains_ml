Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of incompressible Navier--Stokes and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) demands strict enforcement of divergence-free constraints, stability at high Reynolds numbers, and affordable pressure or magnetic potential solves. Recent machine learning (ML) techniques promise to accelerate projection steps, improve constraint preservation, and reduce wall-clock cost, yet achieving physically faithful solutions requires principled coupling between ML surrogates and classical solvers. This draft surveys constraint-aware numerical and ML methods, synthesizes a taxonomy of architectural and loss-based strategies, and outlines a research plan to develop hybrid DNS pipelines that accelerate Poisson/projection components while bounding constraint violations and energy drift. We propose evaluation metrics spanning violation norms, spectral invariants, and performance scaling, and sketch a reproducibility checklist toward an open, documented implementation suitable for Overleaf-to-code transition.
