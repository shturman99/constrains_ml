\section{Risks and reproducibility}
\subsection{Risks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Stability regressions:} ML surrogates may introduce phase errors that grow under explicit time stepping, requiring fallback projection or step-size control.
    \item \textbf{Constraint drift:} Soft penalties might be insufficient; mitigation includes hard divergence-free parametrizations and post-step projections.
    \item \textbf{Generalization gaps:} Models may overfit specific Reynolds numbers or boundary conditions. We plan parametric sampling and domain-randomization during training.
    \item \textbf{Hardware coupling:} Speedups may depend on GPU availability; CPU-only paths must remain viable for baselines.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reproducibility checklist}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Version-control all configs and scripts; publish commit hashes.
    \item Fix random seeds; document hardware (CPU/GPU model, interconnect) and software (compiler, CUDA, MPI).
    \item Log training and evaluation via lightweight experiment tracker (e.g., CSV/JSON + TensorBoard); store wall-clock timings and constraint metrics.
    \item Release datasets or generation scripts with parameter grids; include checksum verification.
    \item Provide small regression tests (short trajectories) for CI to validate constraint norms and energy conservation within tolerances.
\end{itemize}
