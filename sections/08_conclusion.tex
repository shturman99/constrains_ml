\section{Conclusion}
We outlined a research agenda for constraint-preserving DNS accelerated by machine learning. Classical projection, constrained transport, and cleaning methods offer strong baselines; ML provides opportunities for faster projections, divergence-free architectures, and learned correctors. The proposed experiments, metrics, and milestones aim to quantify trade-offs between speed and fidelity while maintaining reproducibility. Future work will extend to additional constraints (e.g., realizability of spectra, boundary-layer fidelity) and broader PDE classes.
